"""
Key points:

    - This module contains a solution of the Producer-Consumer Problem,
      which:

        overcomes the shortcoming of the solution, which is part of the previous module
        (
        = uses a `queue.Queue` instance directly,
          instead of first implementing a _very_ simple subclass of `queue.Queue`
          and only then using an instance of that subclass
        );
      
        uses a `queue.Queue` and `threading.Event`;

    - This module, as well as the following paragraph from the official documentation of
      the `queue` module, strongly suggests that
      the `queue.Queue` class is provided (= put forward) by Python Standard Library
      as a standard, go-to solution _precisely_ of the Producer-Consumer Problem.
