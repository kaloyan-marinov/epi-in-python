Key points:

    - This module contains a solution of the Producer-Consumer Problem,
      which:

        overcomes the shortcoming of the solution, which is part of the previous module
        (
        = allows more than 1 value in the pipeline at a time,
          which in turn requires its pipeline to be based on
          a data structure that allows the number to grow and shrink
          as [messages "back up"] from the "producer"
        );
      
        uses a `queue.Queue` and `threading.Event`;

    - This module demonstrates a different way [of stopping] the [background] threads -
      namely, by using a `threading.Event` instance.

        The `threading.Event` object allows one thread to signal an `event`
        while many other threads can be waiting for that `event` [...]

        The key usage in this code is that
        (a) the threads that are waiting for the `event`
        do not necessarily need to stop what they are doing, but
        (b) they can just check the status of the [`event`] every once in a while.

        The triggering of the event can be many things.
        In this example,
        the main thread will simply `time.sleep` for a short time
        and then issue `event.set()` [...]

    - Last but not least,
      this module's solution of the Producer-Consumer Problem does have a shortcoming:
      it implements a `Pipeline` class [as a _very_ simple subclass of] `queue.Queue`.
